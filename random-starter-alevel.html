The white columns reflect the laser light and this corresponds to a 0.  The black columns do not reflect back the reflected light and this is encoded as a 1. Parity error checking allows the scanner to determine which way round the scanner has read the bar code. ","Hardware and Software"],
["Describe the principle of operations of a digital camera","A digital camera uses a charged couple device (CCD). This is an array of tiny light detectors that measures the intensity of light at red green and blue wavelengths that passes though the camera lens. The intensity of light is then converted to an electrical signal that is then encoded into binary values for each colour.  This occurs across all detectors in the CCD array and so a complete picture can be captured. Nowadays we can get cameras on phones that can take 40 Mega pixel images","Hardware and Software"],
["Describe the principle of operations of RFID","RFID is able to uniquely identify an object. Passive RFID chips do not have their own power source which allows for them to be small. The RFID chips get their power source from nearby radio transmitters (or RFID detectors) that are constantly emitting radio waves.  When an RFID chip comes within range of an RFID detector, the chip is powered by the radio waves which activates the chip to transmit a signal to the detector that uniquely identifies the chip.  Active RFID has its own power source which means that it can transmit over longer distances.","Hardware and Software"],
["Explain what general purpose, specialist and bespoke software are", "General purpose software is designed to be widely used in many ways for both business and personal use, specialist Software is developed for a specific use and bespoke software is tailor made software that is developed for a specific organisation or client.","Hardware and Software"],
["Give some examples of system software","Operating system, Utility programs, libraries","Hardware and Software"],
["Explain the purpose of the data bus", "Allows the transfer of data between different computer components including the main memory, processor and input/output controllers.  The data bus sends data in both directions for the processor, and memory, but input controllers send data only and output controllers receive data only.","Architecture"],
["Explain the purpose of the address bus", "The address bus specifies the physical memory address that we wish to write data to or read from.  The processor sends address requests and all the other components receive requests","Architecture"],
["Explain the purpose of the control bus", "The control bus is used to send commands from the processor to other components and to receive status signals from the components.  The control bus sends signals in both directions for all components","Architecture"],
["Explain the difference between von Neumann and Harvard architectures","With von Neuman the data and instructions are stored in the same memory, whereas with Harvard architecture data and instructions are stored seperately","Architecture"],
["Explain the difference between direct address mode and immediate addressing mode","Immediate addressing mode – The data value in the operand is part of the instruction. In other words this is the actual value we apply the operation to, direct addressing mode – The operand specifies the address of the data in its memory location","Architecture"],
["What is an interrupt?","Interrupts are messages from software applications or hardware that request processing resources from the processor. If the processor is performing operations already then those processes can be interrupted and suspended and the CPU processes the interrupt request","Architecture"],
["What is the word length of  a processor?","The number of bits that can be processed in a single operation","Architecture"],
["Explain the stored program concept","The instructions are stored in main memory.  The instructions are fetched, decoded and executed in the processor","Architecture"], 
["What is the maximum number of memory locations  that can be accessed for a computer system that has a 32 bit address bus?", "2^32","Architecture"],
["Explain what the data, address and control bus do during a write process from the processor to main memory", "Signal to write is placed on control bus, control bus carries the clock signal to synchronise the memory and processor, The data to write are placed on the data bus, and the location in memeory where the data is to be stored is placed on the address bus","Architecture"],
["What is the purpose of data normalisation","To simplify the data structure, to reduce data redundancy and to remove repeating data, to be able to update, remove and search the database, to reduce the size of the database, to reduce anomalies: update, deletion and insertion","Databases"],
["What is the definition of first normal form (1NF)?","The data are atomic, there are no repeating groups of attributes","Databases"],
["What is the defintion of second normal form (2NF)?","Need to be in 1NF (so data are atomic and no repeating groups of attributes) and no partial key dependencies of non-key attributes","Databases"],
["What is the definition of third normal form? (3NF)","Need to be in 1NF and 2NF and no dependencies on non-key attributes","Databases"],
["What methods can be employed to control simultaneous access to a database server from multiple client?","Record locks, Serialisation, Time stamp ordering, commitment ordering","Databases"],
["Explain what a recursive function is and what the general and base case are","A recursive function is a function that calls itself. A base case is used to determine the condition for the recursion to stop. A recursive function must have a base case. Without a base case the recursion will be stuck in an infinite recursion depth. The general case contains the recursive call to the function","Programming"],
["In the context of the object oriented paradigm what is a class?","A class is the blueprint or template for the structure of an object. It contains methods and property/attribute fields that describe the behaviours and characteristics of objects.","Programming"],
["In the context of the object oriented paradigm what is instantiation?","The creating of objects","Programming"],
["In the context of the object oriented paradigm what is a method","Methods define the behaviours of the classes","Programming"],
["In the context of the object oriented paradigm what is inheritance","The methods and attributes of the parent class are shared by the subclass","Programming"],
["In the context of the object oriented paradigm what is the difference between composition and aggregation association","In composition aggregation the child class cannot exist independently of the parent class, whereas for aggregation association the child can exist without the parent class","Programming"],
["In the context of programming, what is a dictionary","A data structure containing one or more key value pairs","Programming"],
["What are local and global variables and what are the advantages of local variables over global variables","Global variables accessible to the whole program and local variables are only accessible within the scope (eg functions) in which they are defined Local variables are removed from memory once the task is complete, Values cannot be changed outside the scope","Programming"],
["What is an intermediate code and why is it used","Intermediate code lies between high level code and low level code. Intermediate code is designed to be portable to that an interpreter can be developed to each machine architecture so there is no need to compile each time for difference machines, thereby making the code more portable. In addition intermediate code protcts the integrity of the source code","Programming"],
["Explain the difference between a procedure and a function","A function always returns a value when called","Programming"],
["What are the components of a stack frame?","local variables, return address, parameters, register values","Programming"],
["In the context of the object oriented paradigm, Explain what overriding means", "A method in the subclass has the same name as method in the parent class but has different behaviour","Programming"],
["What is meant by an imperative high level programming language?", "Operations performed in a sequence", "Programming"],
["What is the difference between assembly language and machine code?","Machine code is in binary, Assembly language still need translating, and Assembly language uses mnemonics", "Programming"],
["What is the difference between viruses and worms?","Worms attach to network tools and are self-replicating whereas virus' require user intervention, viruses are attached to files, where as worms are standalone","Security"],
["Describe the steps for sending a digital signature from computer A to computer B","Apply a hash (one way encryption), to the message to produce the message digest. Encrypt the message digest using the Computer A's (the sender’s) private key ato produce the digital signature, S. Append the signature to the original message and encrypt using computer B’s (the receiver’s) public key to produce the ciphertext C to be sent.","Security"]
